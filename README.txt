This is my AdVenture Capitalist! Timemachine.
I used a Win7 Virtual machine and disconnected the lan adapter.
The Script is inteded to run at a resolution of 1280x960 which is a standard resolution.
It Deletes the local Steam savegame, then sets the time to year8900 and starts AdvCap
Then you get all the money from 6000 years farming... it does investors upgrades and manager purchases.
then lvls all the businesses .. then exits
Then it starts steam to create a new savegame and repeats the cycle ....
You will not reach max lvl with this method however
Because the game is built to increase time needed to reach max exponentially.
Therefore it will never reach max lvl. 
You can however use cheat engine to reach max lvl ....
